# Azure SIEM Lab (Microsoft Sentinel with Honeypot)

A hands-on project demonstrating **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** using **Microsoft Sentinel** in **Azure** with a deployed honeypot.

---

## üìå Project Overview

This lab simulates a real-world security monitoring scenario by deploying a **Windows Honeypot Virtual Machine (VM)** in Azure, generating attack events, and collecting logs for analysis in **Microsoft Sentinel**.

Key objectives:

- Deploy and configure Azure resources for SIEM integration.
- Generate real attack logs from a publicly exposed honeypot.
- Ingest security events into Microsoft Sentinel via **Log Analytics Workspace**.
- Use **Kusto Query Language (KQL)** to detect malicious activities.
- Visualize attacker geolocation using Sentinel **Watchlists**.

The project workflow includes:

1. **Azure Resource Setup**  
   - Created a **Resource Group** and **Virtual Network** in Azure.
   - Deployed a **Windows VM as a Honeypot**, configured with **open inbound rules** in its **Network Security Group** to attract attackers.

2. **Honeypot Configuration**  
   - Disabled **Windows Firewall** to ensure accessibility.

   - Verified external connectivity by allowing all network traffic.

3. **Event Generation**  
   - Simulated multiple **failed login attempts**.
   - Observed **Event ID 4625 (Failed Logon)** in Windows Event Viewer.

4. **Log Ingestion to SIEM**  
   - Created **Log Analytics Workspace** to collect logs.
   - Deployed **Microsoft Sentinel** and linked it to the workspace.
   - Installed **Azure Monitoring Agent** on VM to forward security events.

5. **Log Analysis in Microsoft Sentinel**  
   - Built custom queries in **KQL**:

6. **Geolocation Analysis**  
   - Created a **Watchlist** for IP Geolocation enrichment.

   - Generated an **Attack Map** to visualize attacker locations after 12 hours.

## ‚úÖ What I Learned

- How to **deploy and configure Azure resources** for SIEM.
- Captured **real attacker traffic** through a honeypot setup.
- Forwarded logs securely to **Microsoft Sentinel** for analysis.
- Used **KQL** queries for filtering and detecting brute-force attacks.
- Enriched logs with geolocation data using **Watchlists**.
- Built **visual dashboards** (attack map) for actionable intelligence.
